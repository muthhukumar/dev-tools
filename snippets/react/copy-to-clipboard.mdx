title: Copy to Clipboard in React
description: This function is used to copy the text to the Clipboard
---

```ts
export const copyToClipboard = (data: string, successCallback?: (data: any) => void): void => {
  try {
    navigator.clipboard.writeText(data)
    if (successCallback) successCallback(data)
  } catch {
    return
  }
}
```

This function will get the text and will copy it to the clipboard. Once the copy is done, if the
callback is provided then will the call the callback with the data.
